I"ä<p class="text-justify">It is a myth that channel bonding brings tremendous coverage than regular channelization. Channel bonding gives considerably little lesser coverage than normal channelization. So, what is the advantage of channel bonding? It conspicuously provides better performance and better throughput. Rolling up the coverage area inward a bit; hence, it escapes from interference which helps hugely from the client-side for connectivity, performance, and throughput.</p>
