Welcome to my realm!

In May 2003, I received my Master of Computer Application from the University of Chennai. Programming was challenging for me. To remain in IT, I opted to take a detour via Hardware and Networking. Now that programming is necessary, I have learned Python, which is very basic for automatons. Now I'm learning Git to post all my notes and references. In addition, I'm stashing my works on this site for my wireless expert-level certification. With the hope that it will benefit anybody who wanders across my website.

I've always been interested in wireless. It is a kind of magic that transmits data over the air. During the pandemic, I decided to get my vendor-neutral wireless certification, from CWNP. I completed all the prerequisites and am now preparing for the CWNE.
